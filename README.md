# Super Mario
This clone of Super Mario Bros was created as an asssignment for Advanced Programming course at University of Tehran.

It is written with [RSDL](https://github.com/UTAP/RSDL) (SDL2 Wrapper). Note that using inheritance and polymorphism was forbidden for this project, which made it a bit messy.

## How to play
Compile the project using makefile. run the game with name of the level as argument.
```bash
./game.out 1.txt
```
A sample level is provided with the files (1.txt). you can also create your own levels as a text file.

## Creating your own level
